        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I m a passionate Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>, where I'm pursuing my degree with a focus on software engineering, artificial intelligence, and motorsports technology. My fascination with Formula 1 racing drives my interest in real time data processing, predictive analytics, and high performance computing systems.</p>
        <p>As a dedicated student and aspiring software engineer, I believe in the power of technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. My academic journey has equipped me with decent programming skills in multiple languages, while my passion for Formula 1 has inspired me to explore how technology transforms the world of motorsports. From telemetry data analysis to race strategy optimization, I am fascinated by the intersection of computer science and high speed competition.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I actively participate in co curricular and competitive  events, including the TAMUG Hackathon 2024 where I demonstrated my leadership and technical skills. I'm committed to continuous learning and staying current with emerging technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible, whether in motorsports technology, software development or AI driven solutions.</p>
        <p>This portfolio showcases my future projects plans, academic achievements, and community involvement. I invite you to explore my work and discover how my passion for technology and Formula 1 translates . I hope you will find something here that sparks your interest and opens the door to meaningful conversations about the future of technology.</p>
